# MLP-DecisionTree-SVM_classifier-irisdataset
 Multi-layer Perceptron classifier, Support Vector Machines and Decision Tree Classifier algorithm applied on IRIS dataset(available in Sklearn) to test for accuracy of classification of iris plants into three species (Iris-setosa,Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica).

Iris Dataset is used in this project, which is available in Sklearn(The sklearn. datasets package embeds some small toy datasets as introduced in the Getting Started section).  
It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower.
Number of Instances: 150  
Number of Attributes: 4 numeric, predictive attributes and the class  
    :Attribute Information:  
        - sepal length in cm

        - petal length in cm  
        - petal width in cm  
        - class:  
                - Iris-Setosa  
                - Iris-Versicolour

Classifiers:  
1) *Multi-layer Perceptron*: a supervised learning algorithm that learns a function by training on a dataset  
2) *Decision Trees*: are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression.    
3) *Support Vector Machines*: are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection.
